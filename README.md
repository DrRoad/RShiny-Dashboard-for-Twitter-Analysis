# twitter_RShiny_application
Hi,

The following code produces a  RShiny Dashboard which is created with the intent to illustrate both the: 
> * tweeting habits of an individual
>  * measure the user engagement generated by each tweet

The more tweets a person generates, the more clear the habits become.

The following plots are produced via the plotly library and are therefore fully interactive in any internet browser. I encourage any user of the application to tinker with the application available at: https://nipunjeet-singh-gujral.shinyapps.io/Shiny_App_v2/. Enjoy.

#### In the near future:
* Will be adding another tab to including sentiment analysis.
* Will bee adding another tab including network analysis between individuals and their respective followers 
#### Warning:

 * As the code stands, importing a copy into R will not result in a functioning application, unless you can produce your own
	 > * consumer key
	  > * consumer secret
	  > *  authentication key
	  > * authentication secret

and then insert those four key pieces of information inside the **authentication** function,  in place of the underscores,  located in the  __gitub export functions__ script.

* Instructions to produce the aforementioned key pieces of information are available at:
